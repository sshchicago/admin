   has a lot of email addresses to add to the list, as well as personal contacts.
   Help with MailChimp would be awesome. In particular, talked to Jackie of Level Up,
   who is working on a makerspace targeted to high school students. Lawers for the Creative Arts
   could be very helpful in the incorporation process. Argonne National Labs might be interested
   in holding lectures and seminars with us. Lots of other cool people to keep in touch with,
   expect updates on the mailing list!

   The important point is that we will continue to evolve these as needed.
