# Potpourri
- Getting our own internet service
  - Not a lot of great options, unfortunately
  - AT&T Fiber
    - Dedicated line service only (because they have to build out the infrastructure to us)
    - No build out or installation fee if within 1000FT of already existing fiber (we probably are)
    - $882/mo for 100/100
    - $1843/mo for gig/gig
  - Google Webpass
    - Point-to-point wireless (just like 12Global) backed by fiber, so could degrade in bad weather
    - $3000 installation fee (can be split over 12 months)
    - $100 for 250/250
    - $250 for gig/gig
  - Comcast Business
    - The building had them before and it was prone to outages
    - I mean, come on, it's Comcast
    - $70 (12 months, then $85) for 35/7, 2 year agreement
    - $190 (12 months) for 200/30, 1 year agreement
    - $110 (12 months, then $130) for 200/20, 2 year agreement
    - $260 (12 months) for gig/35, 1 year agreement
    - $100 (12 months, then $200) for gig/35, 2 year agreement, includes phone
      - Probably the "best" option
