Events - 

    -Hack the attack is on this weekend
    -Bubbly Dynamics open house on Saturday.  Per Jeff: This Saturday December 1st from noon to 5pm, Bubbly Dynamics is having an open studio day. Jeff will be there to greet people, but the more the merrier. Also if you have any cool 3d prints you want to do or any cool laser projects, Saturday would be a good day to do it to show off our equipment. I don't know what the foot traffic is going to be like but it should be fun: https://www.facebook.com/events/504970449983535/

One Membership Tier Proposal (see email) - Fill out the survey!
Snowbird memberships? Low average rate throughout the year, but they live elsewhere and only would use the space intermittenly throughout the year.
Keep in mind that this wouldn't take effect for several months

    -Seconded by Dmitry
    -$2,300 approximately, but going to shop around
    -Can do CAD in it
