  - 
  
  - Proposals
    - **Guest instructor comped membership (discussion phase)**
      - May be a good idea to have the month begin the month before the class.
      - Also could make sense for instructors to "turn on membership" at a certain time.
      - Will this apply to existing members if they instruct something?
        -  Could be a good idea, or some type of scholarship.
      - How many instructors would actually sign up for membership?
