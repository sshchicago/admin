  - Sanding will be fun; Dmitriy tried the 20min mud at home and it actually worked pretty well at sanding
  - Hard part will be roundy parts
- Talked to Joe Budka about helping us make plans for plywood shelving and workbenches, but he has been too busy to contribute for now

- Tech update: Microsoft licensing makes my head hurt. For the thing we're only allowed to do once, that's specifically for bringing non-compliant pirated Windows installs in spec. I need to go through the hundreds of different Windows licensing options on TechSoup and figure out which makes sense for us. :/
- Only need license on the Xeon tower that drives the lasercutter; everything else is up-to-date licenses or Linux
