# Public Relations (Mark C)
  - Update on gallery night. I would like to wait one more third Friday before asking the public to come and look at art and take tours. We are supposed to get tons of wind and ice between now and then, it should be frigid and slick, and by next month Chicago may join Illinois in lifting a mask mandate, not that we need to follow that.

It is also grossly under promoted and by that I mean not promoted at all (I am on fumes getting ready for the last tour week). I would like to clean the space a bit more and make a good showing.
