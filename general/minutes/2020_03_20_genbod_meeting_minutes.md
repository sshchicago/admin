# Business
  - 
  
  - Proposals
    - New laser
         - Faster, Stronger laser. More durable. Most components included.
         - (not as important to us but still cool): Super safe, going to run on the same things we have. Should keep itself cleaner then normal. 
         - Why would we do something like this as opposed to omtech, which would be twice as strong, twice as big of a bed, and half the price? 
         - 2 Year warranty
         - Why is the lead time so long?
         - INFO: Ray owns a company that also sells lazers, could be at least looking into.
         - Where would we put it?
         - Not seconded. The proposal will not move into discussion.
