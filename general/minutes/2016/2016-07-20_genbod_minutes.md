Agenda
------

- Sales tax exemption: Dmitriy is starting the process
- Register the vending machine: We're in a weird limbo because we're an NFP, not a business, maybe
- TEM/Ebay
  - Scrapped everything but vacuum pumps and sputter coater - profit: ~$18
  - Packed up the vacuum pump that sold and shipped it - profit: also ~$18
  - Sputter coater listing ends in a few days
  - Vacuum pumps don't take up much room, will keep for a bit
- Building Issues
  - Roof leak - looks like they removed the plants at least and will be working on it soon.
  - Heating fan - to be removed this week, maybe (John promised to, for realsies this time?)
  - Vending Machine - may need to remind them
  - Maybe building cleanup day one day?
- Buildout
  - Stainless steel table gone
  - Dmitriy failed to bore a better hole for server room exhaust, is asking John to help
  - Took stuff to scrapper
  - Moved excess 3D printers into back room storage (for now)
  - Up next:
    - Build workstation #2
    - Have Shawn install lights in back - need bigger ladder
    - Close up drywall in back
    - Maybe build moving partition and additional workstations for 3D area
    - After this we are pretty much done with major build out, back to small projects and maybe dust collector
  - Members: let's get hands on with designing the wood shop and 3D area!
- Hack Scholars
  - Sanjin is in Bosnia, James is out of town, everyone else is on summer break
  - Insurance
    - Current insurance is $750/yr, does not let us weld
    - Agocs has a quote for insurance at $1268/yr that would allow us to weld
    - We make just enough to afford this new rate
    - Should we?
      - General consensus is yes
      - Questions for insurer: minors? forge?
      - We can divide into n equal payments, n<=10 (2 is Agocs's recommendation)
