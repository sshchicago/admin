Unofficial Meeting Minutes for 2016-06-22
=========================================

- Actual Meeting canceled for bad weather but some folks showed up
- Jessica has a poll up for when to do the blood drive with Lifesource; look for it on our FB group or the member's list
- Sanjin is looking at places to benefit from a fundraiser-type thing too; one place is swamped with support right now (yay!); no response from Benton House
