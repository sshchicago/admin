Everyone will look over the Hackerspaces website (http://hackerspaces.org), particularly the page on Design Patterns (http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Design_Patterns). Everyone should also look over MIBS Simplified Rules of Coordinated Consensus through Chaos (http://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/MIBS_Rules).
