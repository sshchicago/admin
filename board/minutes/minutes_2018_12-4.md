   -Idea: role termination updates and membership tier updates into one rollout
   -Retain mechanism that allows Board to tell Member that they have certain number of days to fix identified problem or have membership terminated
   
-One Membership Tier Proposal - Survey results
   -Only 3 people would quit
      -1 was going to quit in February anyways
      -1 was a $10 member
   -We had 3 that agreed to continue donating (Mason, Agocs)
   -Raffle was not that popular
   -Was popular to offer discounts to members, but less so to offer discounts to board members (perverse incentives)
   -A couple of members are geographically not around, but still come every now and then - may consider snowbird memberships for members that don't use the space very often, get a lower rate
      -Will be some requirement that they be a full member for 3 or 6 months
      -Stripe may make this possible - $30 per month, your key scans 12 times a year
      -Stripe works on "invoicing" with discounts and fees that can be applicable (would need to learn code)
   -Comment from survey: don't want to not include the poorer members with the higher membership price.  
      -However, don't know how many members actually fall into this category - seems like most folks are just getting a good deal.
      -Hack Scholars could address this somewhat
      -We could work with folks who legitimate claims (i.e. sweep once a week and we'll knock $10 off your dues)
      -But then we run into the problem of people being embarrased to disclose their incomes to us 
      -New system makes all people full members so they may be more engaged
 -Will "low-key" look at testing out stripe
         
 -Potpouri
    -Do we want to make a donation to charity annually?
    -Do we want to buy an AED (automatic electronic difribulator)? Ballpark $1,500. Replace pads every 2 years
    -We could pay for safety training (CPR, etc) or have people come in to do trainings at the space
    -Start a budget for guest speakers?
