## Open Items
==========
- Tags:
  - Shawn and Dmitriy are about to start testing the system tomorrow.
- RPA :
  - Laser
    - Email was sent to FSL. We are in the bottom tier of importance :/ Are they gonna ask us to send them the controller board again? if they do it could be $200-$1000.
    - Last time we sent it in was in 2022.
    - If it's closer to $1000 we will say no and invest it in another laser cutter? Maybe only 2 or three option. One is **epilogue*, close to $10k, great support, has a rent to own. Other lasers are more standard and they would be Universal or Voss(?) We could also potentially get an after-market FSL.

  - **RPA AREA SECTION **
    - Focus on the electronics bench.
      -Table is not on wheels, nor is it secured to the floor. It is moveable by shimmying it.
      - Looking at other manufacturers as well
      - Roughly looking at $3000-$4000 for a new electronics workbench.
      - Generally in favor, going to get quote for just shelfs and electronic's bench and then rediscuss.


## Potpourri
