- Events
  - GitG was "pretty fun". Well attended - in the 20s!
  - November 15: Game Day!
  - TBD December: Parallel Play Miniatures!
  - Third Friday Art Night is getting less active. Should it be more parellel play instead of art focused? PROBABLY NOT!
  - Potential workshop leaders - send us their contact information! (Bring up at GB Meeting)
    - Karl might give a workshop workshop
  - Holiday party is usually in January to avoid competing holiday parties. Early March is birthday party. On location. Mostly a social mingle. Optional "white elephant" last year. Could skip! Karaoke in the free pile!
    - Focused on mingling
    - Champagne (or possibly Malort?)
    - Can we get liquid nitrogen? Let's make ice cream! 
  - Idea from board dinner: "showcase party" (Tyler). Have people with cool stuff set up around the space as a reason to mingle. Curation/Interaction is really helpful. Could maybe combine with 3rd Friday but that's probably way too often. Let's set a date! Combine with Birthday Party!!!!
  - Projects in Progess ? (No)
- CTO
  - Adam updated the website board members
  - Shawn is not here
  - FYI John is supposedly installing the intercom tomorrow at Bubbly (Wed)
    - D will assess the situation and maybe pull a wire after this
- Yard
  - Let's not track this in the board meeting anymore
- Etc
  - Pies were a success. Let's get more involved next year! Pie-ara print! Small metal awards!
  - Still need to order business cards and stickers. Ziggo knows good sticker sources - StickerUp, VistaPrint
    - Short term: The sticker files are in the computer, let's get them printed somewhere good. Dmitriy is ordering.
    - Long term: Let's make this a competition and the winner gets a free month membership - tie in to Karl's Dec/Jan plans
  - Proposal to have pizza or some other food at general body meetings to try to increase attendance. $25/week for a couple months while tracking attendance?
    - Let's do it after the holidays!
